%% NUMERICAL APPROXIMATION OF JACOBIAN
% 
% Numerical approximation of the Jacobian of a non-linear system
% in the form f(x(t),u(t),t) + G w(t), using five-point method
% or complex step arithmetic for improved accuracy. Note that this function 
% only works for function handles with two variables: x and u. Both can be vectors.

function Jx = numjacobian(f,x)
    
    n = size(x,1); % set size of state vector
    m = size(f(x),1); % number of functions in system
    step = 1e-4; % difference step size

    % preallocate matrix for speed
    Jx = zeros(m,n);
    
    for i=1:n
       %xstep = x;
       % compute the i-th component partial derivative 
       % numerically using first order (Euler) forward difference approximation
       %xstep(i) = x(i)+step;
       %J(:,i) = (feval(f,xstep,0)-fx)/step;
       
       % Make step vector for i-th index by only setting variable xi
       % non-zero to find df(x)/dxi
       h = zeros(size(x)); h(i) = step;
       
       % Five-point method, higher order first derivative approximation
       xstep2 = x + 2*h;
       xstep1 = x + h;
       xstepm2 = x - 2*h;
       xstepm1 = x - h;
       Jx(:,i) = (-feval(f,xstep2) + 8*feval(f,xstep1) - 8*feval(f,xstepm1) + feval(f,xstepm2))/(12*step);

%     % Alternatively, use complex step arithmetic for higher accuracy
%     h = n * eps;                            % differentiation step size, eps = machine epsilon
%     for k = 1:n                             % loop for each independent variable 
%         x1 = x;                             % reference point
%         x1(k) = x1(k) + h*1i;               % increment in kth independent variable
%         Jx(:,k) = imag(f(x1))/h;             % complex step differentiation
